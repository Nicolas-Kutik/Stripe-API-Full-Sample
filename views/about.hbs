        Welcome to Stripe API Sample! We are a fictional online store created to demonstrate the power of Stripe payments integration. Our mission is to provide developers and learners with a safe, hands-on environment to explore e-commerce features, payment flows, and modern web development best practices.

        Our "products" are for demonstration purposes only and cannot be shipped or purchased in real life. All transactions are simulated using Stripe's test mode, so you can experiment freely without spending real money.
